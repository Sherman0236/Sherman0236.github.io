# Hi there!

My name is Sherman0236, and I am a software engineer with a passion for reverse engineering and game hacking. I specialize in using tools such as IDA, WinDbg, and x64dbg to research vulnerabilities in kernel-mode and user-mode binaries. I utilize programming languages such as C++, C#, and HTML/CSS, and I'm always looking to learn more.

Please feel free to connect with me to discuss reverse engineering, game hacking, and software engineering! I'm always interested in meeting new people who share my interests and learning from their experiences.
